## Columns

The TSVs in this folder each contain all notes of one of the movements with their temporal positions and other features.

The data type `Int64` stands for integer columns containing NULL values.

| **tied**             | Int64    | Encodes ties on the note's left (`-1`), on its right (`1`) or both (`0`). A tie merges a note with an adjacent one having the same pitch. ``: No ties. This note represents an onset and ends after the given duration. `1`: This note is tied to the next one. It represents an onset but not a note ending. `0`: This note is being tied to *and* tied to the next one. It does not represent an onset, nor a note ending. `-1`: This note is being tied to. That is, it does not represent an onset, instead it adds to the duration of a previous note on the same pitch and ends it. In case the ties are merged via the parameter `-T`, only `1` remains, `-1` and `0` are dropped and the durations merged. |
| **tpc**              | integer  | Tonal Pitch Class. Encodes note names by their position on the line of fifth with `0` = C, `1` = G, `2` = D, `-1` = F, `-2` = `Bb` etc. The octave is defined by `midi DIV 12 - 1`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **voice**            | integer  | In which notational layer the note occurs. `1` = upper layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **volta**            | Int64    | Disambiguates endings: `1` for first endings, `2` for second endings. This column is present only for disambiguation in the raw data because `mozart_loader.py` has been designed to correctly deal with first and second endings by deleting first endings or unfolding repetitions (parameter `-u`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
