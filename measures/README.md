## Columns

The TSVs in this folder each hold information about every measure of one movement. This information is necessary for keeping track of the different numberings `mc` and `mn`, for computing the repeat structure, and for knowing about special bar lines such as `double`.

The data type `Int64` stands for integer columns containing NULL values.

| **mc**               | integer               | Measure count, identifier for the measure units in the XML encoding. Always starts with 1 for correspondence to MuseScore's status bar.                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **keysig**           | integer               | Key signature as the amount of accidentals. Sharps as positive, flats as negative integers. `1` = G major / E minor; `-1` = F major / D minor.                                                                                                                                                          |

| **act_dur**          | fraction              | Actual duration of the `mc` expressed as fraction of a whole note (`1/4` = quarter note).                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| **numbering_offset** | Int64                 | Number to be added to this and all subsequent `mn`s, determined by the "Add to bar number" functionality in MuseScore.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **dont_count**       | Int64                 | If `1`, this `mc` is not counted as the next `mn`. Otherwise NULL. Determined by the "Exclude from bar count" functionality in MuseScore and used for upbeat measures (also within the piece), second endings, cadencas spanning several bars etc.                                                      |
| **next**             | collection or integer | One or several `mc`s that can follow this `mc`. If there are several measures that may follow (in the case of repetions), the integers are separated by `, ` (comma + space). In case the unfolded parameter `-u` is being used, this column holds integers only because repetitions are disambiguated. |
