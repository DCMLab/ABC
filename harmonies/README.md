## Columns

The TSVs in this folder each contain all chord labels of one of the movements with their temporal positions.

For all features given as Roman numerals (`localkey, pedal, numeral, relativeroot`), the scale degrees `III, VI, VII` depend on the local mode: In a local minor key (`localkey_is_minor == 1`), they are a minor 3rd/6th/7th above the local tonic, in major, a major 3rd/6th/7th.

Columns in bold face hold information that is encoded in the annotators' labels, the others are derived features.

The data type `Int64` stands for integer columns containing NULL values.

| **localkey**       | string     | Local key expressed as Roman numeral relative to the `globalkey`, e.g. `IV` for the major key on the 4th scale degree or `#iv` for the minor scale on the raised 4th scale degree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **pedal**          | string     | If the chord occurs over a pedal note, this pedal note is expressed as a Roman numeral.

| **form**           | string     | ``: The chord is either a major or minor triad if `figbass` is one of ``, '6', '64'`. Otherwise, it is either a major or a minor chord with a minor seventh. `o, +`: Diminished or augmented chord. Again, it depend on `figbass` whether it is a triad or a seventh chord. `%, M`: Half diminished or major seventh chord. For the latter, the chord form depends on the Roman numeral.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **figbass**        | string     | Figured bass notation of the chord inversion. For triads, this feature can be `, '6', '64'`, for seventh chords `'7', '65', '43', '2'`. This features is decisive for which chord tone is in the bass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **changes**        | string     | A string containing all **added** intervals, all **replacing** intervals, and all chord tone **alterations**. All intervals are given as arabic numbers standing for the scale degree found above the `numeral` in the current local scale. E.g., `+6`, over the numeral `V`, would add a major sixth in a local major key, and a minor sixth in a local minor key. A minor sixth added to the dominant in a major key would be `+b6`. **Replacing** intervals and **alterations** are not preceded by `+`. Alterations are changes to the chord tones `3, 5, 8, 10, 12`. All other intervals replace a chord tone. If preceded by `#`, they replace the upper neighbor (e.g. `#2` replace the chordal third. Otherwise, they replace the lower neighbour (e.g. `2` replaces the root, `9` replaces the octave). |
| **relativeroot**   | string     | This feature designates a lower-level key to which the current chord relates. It is expressed relative to the local key. For example, if the current numeral is a `V` and it is a secondary dominant, `relativeroot` is the scale degree that is being tonicized. Column is not present if the chord labels are relative to the global key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
