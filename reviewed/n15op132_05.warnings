DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 62, '0', 'IV(6)') ms3.Parse.ABC.n15op132_05
	The label 'IV(6)' in m. 62, onset 0 (MC 62, onset 0) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of a.v, it expresses the scale degrees
	('4', '#6', '2') [('A', 'C#', 'F#')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 4 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.8 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
