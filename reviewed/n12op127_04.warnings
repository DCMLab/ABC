DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 2, '3/4', 'I') ms3.Parse.ABC.n12op127_04
	The label 'I' in m. 2, onset 3/4 (MC 2, onset 3/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).

	('1', '3', '5') [('Eb', 'G', 'Bb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 4 within-label and 12 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.75 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
