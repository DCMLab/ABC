============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 80, '1/2', 'V') ms3.Parse.ABC.n03op18-3_01
	The label 'V' in m. 80, onset 1/2 (MC 80, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of D.V, it expresses the scale degrees
	('5', '7', '2') [('E', 'G#', 'B')].
	The corresponding score segment has 2 within-label and 4 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
