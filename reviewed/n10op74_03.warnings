============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 69, '0', 'ii') ms3.Parse.ABC.n10op74_03
	The label 'ii' in m. 67, onset 0 (MC 69, onset 0) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of c.i, it expresses the scale degrees
	('2', '4', '#6') [('D', 'F', 'A')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 6 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
