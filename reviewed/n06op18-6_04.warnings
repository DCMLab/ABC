DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 31, '1/4', '#viio43/iii') ms3.Parse.ABC.n06op18-6_04
	The label '#viio43/iii' in m. 31, onset 1/4 (MC 31, onset 1/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of Bb.i, it expresses the scale degrees
	('6', 'b1', '2', '4') [('Gb', 'Bbb', 'C', 'Eb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 6 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
