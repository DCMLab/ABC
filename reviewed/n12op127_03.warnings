DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 57, '0', 'i.#viio6') ms3.Parse.ABC.n12op127_03
	The label 'i.#viio6' in m. 56, onset 0 (MC 57, onset 0) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of Eb.i, it expresses the scale degrees
	('2', '4', '#7') [('F', 'Ab', 'D')].
	The corresponding score segment has 3 within-label and 5 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.625 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
