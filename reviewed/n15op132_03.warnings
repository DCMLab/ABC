Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review
============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 86, '3/4', 'I6') ms3.Parse.ABC.n15op132_03
	The label 'I6' in m. 85, onset 3/4 (MC 86, onset 3/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of C.I, it expresses the scale degrees
	('3', '5', '1') [('E', 'G', 'C')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
