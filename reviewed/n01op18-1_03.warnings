Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review
============================================================

FIRST_BAR_MISSING_TEMPO_MARK_WARNING (29,) ms3.Parse.ABC.n01op18-1_03
	No metronome mark found in the first measure nor anywhere else in the score.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 32, '1/2', 'ii') ms3.Parse.ABC.n01op18-1_03
	The label 'ii' in m. 32, onset 1/2 (MC 32, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of F.i, it expresses the scale degrees
	('2', '4', '#6') [('G', 'Bb', 'D')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 34, '1/2', 'vi') ms3.Parse.ABC.n01op18-1_03
	The label 'vi' in m. 34, onset 1/2 (MC 34, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of F.i, it expresses the scale degrees
	('6', 'b1', '3') [('Db', 'Fb', 'Ab')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 3 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 110, '0', 'viio65') ms3.Parse.ABC.n01op18-1_03
	The label 'viio65' in m. 110, onset 0 (MC 110, onset 0) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).

	('b2', 'b4', 'b6', '7') [('Gb', 'Bbb', 'Dbb', 'Eb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 5 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
