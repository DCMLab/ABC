# The Annotated Beethoven Corpus (ABC) (A corpus of annotated scores)

The ABC dataset consists of expert harmonic analyses of all Beethoven string quartets 
(opp. 18, 59, 74, 95, 127, 130, 131, 132, 135, composed between 1800 and 1826), encoded in a human- and 
machine-readable format (MuseScore format). 
Using a modified Roman Numeral notation (the [DCML harmony annotation standard](https://github.com/DCMLab/standards)), 
the dataset includes the common music-theoretical set of harmonic features such as key, chordal root, 
chord inversion, chord extensions, suspensions, and others.


## Getting the data

* download repository as a [ZIP file](https://github.com/DCMLab/ABC/archive/main.zip)
* download a [Frictionless Datapackage](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/) that includes concatenations
  of the TSV files in the four folders (`measures`, `notes`, `chords`, and `harmonies`) and a JSON descriptor:
  * [ABC.zip](https://github.com/DCMLab/ABC/releases/latest/download/ABC.zip)
  * [ABC.datapackage.json](https://github.com/DCMLab/ABC/releases/latest/download/ABC.datapackage.json)
* clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/DCMLab/ABC.git` 


## Data Formats

Each piece in this corpus is represented by five files with identical name prefixes, each in its own folder. 
For example, the first movement of the first quartet, op. 18/1, has the following files:

* `MS3/n01op18-1_01.mscx`: Uncompressed MuseScore 3.6.2 file including the music and annotation labels.
* `notes/n01op18-1_01.notes.tsv`: A table of all note heads contained in the score and their relevant features (not each of them represents an onset, some are tied together)
* `measures/n01op18-1_01.measures.tsv`: A table with relevant information about the measures in the score.
* `chords/n01op18-1_01.chords.tsv`: A table containing layer-wise unique onset positions with the musical markup (such as dynamics, articulation, lyrics, figured bass, etc.).
* `harmonies/n01op18-1_01.harmonies.tsv`: A table of the included harmony labels (including cadences and phrases) with their positions in the score.

Each TSV file comes with its own JSON descriptor that describes the meanings and datatypes of the columns ("fields") it contains,
follows the [Frictionless specification](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-resource/),
and can be used to validate and correctly load the described file. 

### Opening Scores

After navigating to your local copy, you can open the scores in the folder `MS3` with the free and open source score
editor [MuseScore](https://musescore.org). Please note that the scores have been edited, annotated and tested with
[MuseScore 3.6.2](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/releases/tag/v3.6.2). 
MuseScore 4 has since been released which renders them correctly but cannot store them back in the same format.

### Opening TSV files in a spreadsheet

Tab-separated value (TSV) files are like Comma-separated value (CSV) files and can be opened with most modern text
editors. However, for correctly displaying the columns, you might want to use a spreadsheet or an addon for your
favourite text editor. When you use a spreadsheet such as Excel, it might annoy you by interpreting fractions as
dates. This can be circumvented by using `Data --> From Text/CSV` or the free alternative
[LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/). Other than that, TSV data can be loaded with
every modern programming language.

### Loading TSV files in Python

Since the TSV files contain null values, lists, fractions, and numbers that are to be treated as strings, you may want
to use this code to load any TSV files related to this repository (provided you're doing it in Python). After a quick
`pip install -U ms3` (requires Python 3.10 or later) you'll be able to load any TSV like this:

```python
import ms3

labels = ms3.load_tsv("harmonies/n01op18-1_01.harmonies.tsv")
notes = ms3.load_tsv("notes/n01op18-1_01.notes.tsv")
```

## Remarks

**Hybrid version of annotations**

v1.0 of this dataset used version 1.0.0 of the [DCML harmony annotation standard](https://github.com/DCMLab/standards),
with the version number attributed only in hindsight. Some of the labels that were corrected in the meantime, however,
use features available only in later versions, such as recursive reference to a secondary ('tertiary') key as in `V7/V/V`.
However, changes have been applied conservatively in order to keep the data as homogeneous as possible.

**Possible annotation errors**

While the annotation process (as detailed in the Data Report) was conducted very carefully, and all annotated symbols have been automatically checked for syntactic correctness, the authors cannot entirely rule out the possibility of typograpical errors or misinterpretations (e.g., due to ambiguities in the score or underspecification in the musical texture). After all, music analysis is not a deterministic process but involves interpretation. If you encounter anything that seems not right to you, please create an issue [here](https://github.com/DCMLab/ABC/issues).

**Missing bars**

The original XML file for Op. 132 No. 15, mov. 5 from Project Gutenberg did not contain measures 194-241. We added them manually.

## File naming convention

```regex
n(?P<quartet>\d{2})  # quartet number, e.g. n01
op(?P<op>\d{2,3})    # opus number, e.g. op18
(?:-(?P<no>\d))?     # (optional) number within the opus, e.g. -1
_(?P<mvt>\d{2})      # movement number, e.g. _01
```
