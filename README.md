# ABC - The Annotated Beethoven Corpus

The ABC dataset consists of expert harmonic analyses of all Beethoven string quartet (opp. 18, 59, 74, 95, 127, 130, 131, 132, 135, composed between 1800 and 1826), encoded in a human- and machine-readable format (MuseScore format). Using a modified Roman Numeral notation, the dataset includes the common music-theoretical set of harmonic features such as key, chordal root, chord inversion, chord extensions, suspensions, and others.
